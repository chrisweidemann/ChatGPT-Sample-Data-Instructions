# ChatGPT-Sample-Data-Instructions
A repo for storing sample data and instruction to be used with ChatGPT

People are interested in using ChatGPT at work but are hesitant due to data privacy and data security concerns (which is a healthy hesitation!). To help my clients see the value of LLM's hands on without investing too much time or exposing any company data, I wanted to create instructions and some sample data for them to use. I figured creating the content on Github would actually be the best place to do this, enabling more than just my clients to have access to the content and contribute.

Given that I have a few clients that are currently in a finance role, I decided to start with some finance sample data and instructions. I'll expand from there. Ideas for additional projects include operations data sets, geospatial data, analysis on PDF's, and analysis on fuzzy data.
